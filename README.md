![](./images/image00.png)

This is *early alpha* of KomodoOcean / komodo-qt GUI qt-based wallet for Komodo (KMD). Probably (not sure) is a **world first Qt-Wallet** for ZCash based cryptocurrency forks. Now it available only for Windows (64-bit) and Linux (64-bit) platforms.

**NB!** This repo have two branches:

- *master* for Windows
- *Linux* for Linux

### System requirements ###

- Windows 8 / 8.1 / 10 (64-bit) based PC.
- At least 4 Gb of RAM (8 or 16 Gb RAM recommended).
- About 3.1 Gb of storage space to sync full blockchain (SSD drive is recommended)

Before you start create the following configuration file, named `komodo.conf` in %APPDATA%\Komodo folder:

    rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
    rpcpassword=password
    txindex=1
    addnode=5.9.102.210
    addnode=78.47.196.146
    addnode=178.63.69.164
    addnode=88.198.65.74
    addnode=5.9.122.241
    addnode=144.76.94.38
    addnode=89.248.166.91

And download [sprout-proving.key](https://z.cash/downloads/sprout-proving.key) and [sprout-verifying.key](https://z.cash/downloads/sprout-verifying.key) in %APPDATA%\ZcashParams folder. If you already have installed original komodod.exe (console daemon) for Windows, or Agama Wallet - you already have all needed.

### Project Status ###

Currenly komodo-qt is *under developement*. Use it at your own risk - do not use for mining or merchant applications, also we don't recommend now to use it with your main wallet. Before use you can copy your main wallet.dat in a secure place or use `-datadir` command-line key to select other data folder for use with komodo-qt.

Supported (tested) features:

- Launching GUI interface and syncing blockchain.
- Faster blockchain indexes loading in compare with original komodod for Windows. Estimated speed of loading fully synced blockchain indexes on KMD is **50 sec.** on Core i7-6700K / 64 Gb RAM / SSD drive, that approaches speed of Linux PC with same hardware.
- Receiving and sending coins.
- Extended coin control features, selecting "Inputs..." (UTXOs) when sending coins.
- Supporting assetchains (launch KomodoOceanGUI.exe with needed `-ac_name`, `-ac_supply` and `-addnode` command-line keys to launch wallet on needed assetchain).
- Correct quit from app (earlier versions of komodo-qt wasn't correct shutdown all of running threads).


Existing issues:

- You tell us ... ;)
